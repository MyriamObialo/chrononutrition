The present study is the result of a careful statistical analysis regarding chrono-nutritional data aimed to explore the possible pattern of similarity present in the data with regard to energy intake across times of the day. 
The term “chrono-nutrition” is referred to an emerging discipline that builds on the close connection between endogenous circadian rhythms and metabolism. 
The circadian rhythm  is the natural and internal process that regulates the sleep-wake cycle and repeats, approximately, every 24 hours. This natural rhythm is influenced by external cues , primarily light and darkness, and is found in the majority of living organisms, including animals, plants, and even some bacteria. 
In this study, we delve into the connection between circadian rhythm and nutrition —an evolving area of research revealing how the body's internal clock significantly impacts metabolism, digestion, and overall well-being. 
One of the crucial roles of the circadian rhythm is to regulate and influence the timing of metabolic processes, energy balance, indeed compelling evidence suggests that the timing of dietary intake can exert profound effects on metabolism. 
The circadian clock controls nutrient processing and critical homeostasis by directing the expression and function of proteins involved in the digestion of cholesterol, amino acids, lipids, glycogen, and glucose digestion system. 
By extension, many hormones of the digestive system, such as insulin, glucagon, adiponectin, corticosterone, leptin and ghrelin, present circadian changes. Moreover, disturbance of circadian rhythms is related to occurrence of cancer, metabolic disorder, and change in weight; disharmony in circadian rhythms can compromise the functioning of organs and impact the overall metabolic systems in the body and has been correlated with adverse health outcomes, including diminished energy metabolism, impaired glucose metabolism, and heightened risk of cardiovascular disease .
The digestion system and nutrients provide additional feedback to influence the organic clock.

Research suggests that aligning meal timing with the body's natural circadian rhythm may have metabolic benefits. For instance, the consumption of a majority of calories during the earlier part of the day, when the body is most active and alert, is thought to be more beneficial than late night eating, specifically, studies show that consuming meals later in the day is associated with an elevated prevalence of metabolic disorders, while early time-restricted eating, such as having  an early breakfast and an earlier dinner, improves levels of glucose in the blood and substrate oxidation.   
It was also observed that:

“Consuming a high proportion of energy later during the day and into the night can produce chronodisruption, a state where peripheral clocks are out of synchrony with the central clock, 
located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and aimed to synchronize behaviours with environmental cues. 
A state of chronodisruption can impact many physiological processes.”   (Raphaëlle Jacob, 2023)


However, given the limited biological data in the sample, the primary objective of this study is to identify clusters of individuals based on the caloric intake within distinct time slots and not only to have a comparison between the clusters but also to discern and delineate specific pattern associated with sociodemographic characteristics among the patients. This meant an exploration into whether certain individuals exhibit a tendency to ingest higher caloric quantities during specific time intervals. 
Having information regarding the sociodemographic features can be highly beneficial for understanding the variability present in the data and to target specific individuals when planning specific interventions. The motives explaining the importance of sociodemographic features are several:
•	Working condition: The nature of an individual’s job can affect meal timing; for example, individuals working morning and night shifts may experience differences in meal timing and sleep schedules.
•	Economic diversity: Socioeconomic status significantly impacts individuals' dietary habits. Wealthier individuals may exhibit distinct dietary patterns and variations compared to those with lower socioeconomic status.
•	Chronotype Variations: A chronotype, is the natural preferences of the body for wakefulness and sleep, individual’s chronotype highly influences sleep-wake cycles and eating habits.   
•	Cultural Influences: Different demographic individuals may have distinct preferences for certain food and meal timing, all of which can impact chrono-nutritional considerations. 
Considering sociodemographic information when dealing with chrono-nutritional data helps in creating personalized and culturally relevant recommendations, addressing the disparities, and tailoring it to specific demographic groups.


The study aims to investigate the connection between time-based eating intervals and individuals, along with evaluating their impact on human health   to identify potential individual profiles.
